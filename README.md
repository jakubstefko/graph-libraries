# Welcome

Created from CRA, temlpate typescript.  
Main point is to compare greph libraries and choose which is best for  
my use case (big data set in dashboard-like screen, react + ts).  
I used recharts but it's not enabling some things I need.  
Although will add it's numbers to this readme 4 comparison.

# Libraries to compare

1. d3 (v. 7.8.1)
2. chart.js (v. 4.1.2)
3. dygraph (v. 2.1.0)
4. recharts (v. 2.3.2)
